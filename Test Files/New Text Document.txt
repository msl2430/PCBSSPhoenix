Hi everyone,

Attached please find the following information regarding the upcoming (scheduled for weekend of May 7-8) FAMIS and OMEGA data base changes:

A listing changes being made to accommodate or move in with the new DB.  This listing includes requested production down time and population of new fields’ information. 
A chart of new/modified FAMIS fields 
A chart of new/modified OMEGA fields 
New e105 documents (it seems to take awhile for each page to display the document)
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter
